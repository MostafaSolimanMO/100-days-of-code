### Day 9: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished threads & parallelism lesson on udacity, after a full understanding of Loaders and put it into my code I got some issues then found that Loaders have been deprecated as of Android P, so I tried to learn about ViewModels and LiveData, read a lot of articles and examples but I can't get it yet, so I decided to pass it until having more practice and Explored Google Books API to get ready for the quiz of lesson 4 that create a Book Listing App..today was hard but I'm so excited about tomorrow.
